"""Archive of one-off analysis scripts from pair identification prototype.

These scripts were used during development and debugging of the pair identification
system but are no longer actively maintained. They are preserved here for reference
and historical purposes.

Most of these scripts performed specific analyses:
- Comparing against DSSR output
- Analyzing specific failure modes (CWW misses, greedy conflicts, etc.)
- Generating visualizations and reports
- Validating classifiers and alignment strategies

For current analysis tools, see the main prototype modules and the CLI tools.
