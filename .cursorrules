legacy is org/ code modern is src/ and include/
use a centralized testing framework
focus on easy to read function and clean not fancy
all modern code must have legacy inds when required to compare to org code which is 1-index based so we can directly compare
Keep functions short and focused. If a function does more than one thing, split it up. Aim for functions you can understand at a glance.
Use RAII religiously.
Avoid raw pointers for ownership.
perfer pass by const reference, Pass by rvalue reference (&&) 
Minimal nesting no more than 3 levels
functions shouldnt be longer than 50 lines (100 for special exceptions)
Python testing: All Python tests must use pytest. Test files go in tests_python/ with integration/ and unit/ subdirectories. Use pytest fixtures from conftest.py. Run tests with `pytest tests_python/`. Tools like download_pdbs.py and find_slow_pdbs.py belong in tools/, not scripts/.
always use multiple cores when you can
floating point differences are not a good explanation for differences
