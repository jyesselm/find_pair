# x3dna CMake configuration file
#
# This file is used by find_package(x3dna) to locate the x3dna library
#
# Usage in your project:
#   find_package(x3dna REQUIRED)
#   target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE x3dna::x3dna)
#
# This will provide:
#   - The x3dna library
#   - Include directories
#   - nlohmann_json dependency (transitively linked)
#
# To use the library, initialize ResourceLocator in your main():
#   x3dna::config::ResourceLocator::initialize("/path/to/resources");
# Or use environment-based auto-detection:
#   x3dna::config::ResourceLocator::initialize_from_environment();

# Include the exported targets (includes nlohmann_json as well)
include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/x3dnaTargets.cmake")

# Provide the installed resources path for convenience
set(X3DNA_RESOURCES_DIR "${PACKAGE_PREFIX_DIR}/@CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR@/x3dna/resources")
